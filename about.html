            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>
                Francis Gusteau was born in Paris, France on June 12, 1928 to a family of  
                financially struggling farmers. The Gusteau family decided to move to New York City in 1927, with the purpose of seeking out greater opportunity. In New York the Gusteau's were able to get themselves out of their financial struggle and Francis Gusteau was able to attend Cornell University, in 1946, where he studied architecture. Suprisingly, it was at Cornell where Gusteau discovered his love and passion for the culinary arts and after just 2 years at Cornell, and when he was just 21, Gusteau decided to drop out and pursue his dream of opening up a gourmet restraunt. In 1948, not even 6 months after he had dropped out of Cornell, Gusteau, on his journey with the goal of opening a restraunt decided to move southwest to Arizona. While in Arizona Gusteau, with the financial help of his parents, purchased the land and deteriorating building that would become Gusteau's. However before Gusteau's could become Gusteau's the building first had to restored. Unfortunately for Gusteau he was unable to afford the cost that would come with restoration and his parents no longer could support his dream financially. So Gusteau was left with no choice other than to use the knowledge of architecture he had gained while at Cornell University and restore the building himself. It took Gusteau over 8 months and much blood, sweat, and tears, but the restoration was finally finished. Then just 2 short months later in 1949, the Gusteau's we all know and love was finally established and open for business.It wouldn't take long for Gusteau's to take off, as it brought a whole new culture and assortment foods to the southwest region while also becoming one of the first French restaurants ever established in Arizona. With the establishment and success of Gusteau's, Francis Gusteau  was finally able to say that his dream had become a great success.
